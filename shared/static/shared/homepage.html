    <h2> All About Caffiene: Myths, Benefits, and Risks</h2>
    
    <p>A shocking 85% of Americans drink at least 1 cup of caffeinated drink a day. While caffeine can have some positive boosts like alertness, it’s important that the body does not build up a tolerance to caffeine to maintain these positive effects. If you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages often, you’ve likely built up your tolerance, desensitizing your body to the effects of the stimulant. More caffeine will be required to get the same effects, which can be dangerous if the levels are too high.
